# Welcome
The Multi-Analog-Digital Clock (MAD) creates a mesmerizing real time clock visualization using D3 v4.

# Project
The implementation uses multiple basic concepts of D3 such as [Nested Selections](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/nest/), [Transitions](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/transition/) and [Interpolations](https://github.com/d3/d3-interpolate) 
...and it's also mesmerizing :)
